SSHTerm 1.1 (29.1.2020)

- First released version.


SSHTerm 1.2 (9.2.2020)

- Specifying the KEYFILE argument now implies that public key authentication
  should be used instead of any other method (same as in ssh2-handler).

- Now uses an offscreen buffer for text rendering which should speed up anti-
  aliased text rendering on most platforms.

- Increased read and write buffers in main loop from 256 to 1024 bytes.
